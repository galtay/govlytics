Playing with government data

## Installation

This package was tested with python 2.7.10. 
For best results create a virtual environment, 

```bash
> virtualenv venv
> source venv/bin/acticate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test the installation, run the `legislators.py` file in the `src` directory. 
This should print the name and state of each senator. 

```bash
> python src/legislators.py
```

## Data 

Data on members of congress comes from https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators
